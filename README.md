Mob Programming Team 4

Khalid Aliweh, Erica Albernthy, Mason Tan, Robert Johnson, Shawn Roe

For the remote mob programming practice, we used email to shedule the meeting, we used Google Hangouts for the face-to-face conversations, sharing the requirements and sharing the IDE screen during the session.  We also used the Chrome Desktop Share plugin to share the control of the IDE.

The recordings for this session can be found at:
