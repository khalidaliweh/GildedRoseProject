Mob Programming Team 4
Khalid Aliweh, Erica Albernthy, Mason Tan, Robert Johnson, Shawn Roe

For the remote mob programming practice, we used Google Hangouts for the face-to-face conversations, sharing the requirements and sharing the IDE screen.  We also used the Chrome Desktop Share plugin to share the control of the IDE.
